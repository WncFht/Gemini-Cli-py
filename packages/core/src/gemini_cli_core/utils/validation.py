"""
This file is refactored from packages/core_ts/src/utils/schemaValidator.ts.

In the Python implementation, Pydantic models are used for schema definition
and validation, which is a more robust and idiomatic approach than the
simple validator in the TypeScript version. Therefore, a direct translation
of the SchemaValidator class is not necessary.

This file serves as a placeholder for any future custom validation logic
that might be needed beyond what Pydantic provides.
